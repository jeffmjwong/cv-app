        As a Software Engineer who loves everything tech, I enjoy solving difficult
        problems and build awesome software that emphasized on quality and user experience.

      <p>
        Throughout my career, I have been involved in every aspect of software development
        lifecycles, which include but not limited to - design and sprint planning,
        front end development, back end development, application deployment,
        database operations, debugging, analytics tracking, manual and automatic
        testing, metrics and health monitoring, dependencies management, client
        interactions and product management.

      <p>
        I strongly believe in building software products that will both provide great value
        to the company and that of other developers will enjoy working with.
